This book addresses the needs of humanities scholars who seek deeper expertise in the area of data modeling and representation. The authors, all experts in digital humanities, offer a clear explanation of key technical principles, a grounded discussion of case studies, and an exploration of important theoretical concerns. The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context. This book is a unique and invaluable resource for teaching and practising data modeling in a digital humanities context"--},

          , 
            In areas of human activity where performance is difficult to quantify in an objective fashion, reputation and networks of influence play a key role in determining access to resources and rewards. To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition network that captures the movement of art between institutions. Centrality within this network captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art.},

The aim of this study is to develop and test a strategy for text mining from PDFs of journal articles that have nonstandard formatting and/or use notes rather than full bibliographies for references. While articles in the natural and social sciences typically adhere to standard formats, art history journals employ a variety of formatting styles that make bulk capture of citation and other textual data from the articles challenging. This study outlines a method by which researchers can extract data from journals articles, using a sample set from art history. Once extracted, the data from PDFs can be used to compare frequently used terms across samples and determine which scholars are most cited in either bibliographies or the main body text of articles. If the structure and layout of individual journals are carefully considered and the data is properly cleaned, a clear picture of the disciplinary influences and dependencies of the scholarship through citations and key terms can be obtained.},

Our research highlights a set of desirable components for an innovative, interdisciplinary approach that speaks to both of these scholars using examples of recent publications that show strengths in these areas, stressing the importance of standardizing, diversifying, and sharing data among art market researchers; arguing for minimal standards for statistical analysis, to better consider and reflect the realities of art markets and related data; and providing suggestions for improving communication between disciplines, with collaboration being a clear option for achieving these goals. Based on these suggestions, this paper encourages the development of a hybrid discipline that overcomes the dichotomy between art history and cultural economics and make the most of digital tools’ potential for data gathering and analysis.

	abstract = {In recent years, immersive media have opened up new possibilities for the preservation of cultural heritage. Using Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Virtuality (AV), and Mixed Reality (MxR), cultural organizations around the globe are now transporting audiences to endangered world heritage sites and generating 3D representations of those sites in the audience’s physical environment. Largely untapped, however, is the unique potential of immersive media to preserve the historical experience of these spaces – that is, how people moved through them and assigned them meaning, where they went and why, and what they saw, felt, and heard – which can be as integral to a community’s cultural heritage as its material objects. The following article explores this use of immersive technology through an account of the author’s digital art history and cultural preservation project, Virtual Venice. Renewing the connection between presentday Venice and its rich urban past, the VR/360-video resource enables remote audiences to simulate the historical experience of the city while reaffirming its place in contemporary Venetian life.},

Those working in libraries, archives, and museums are well aware of this fact, as much of their expertise is focused on managing the interactions between their own domains and systems—those of art-historical information—and the domains and systems in which art-historical knowledge is produced, by curators, professors, critics, and other practitioners of art history. We know that computing technologies—in their use to manage art-historical information, in researching and writing art-historical scholarship, and in making works of art as well—raise questions that as a field we have yet to fully grasp or articulate, much less answer. This article provides a brief overview of the domain and systems of information management and consider how our information infrastructure has changed over the last twenty or so years. This overview will provide a means for exploring the implications of changes in our information infrastructure for the researching and writing of art history.},

	abstract = {The technological progress of the past decades has had a transformative effect on both cultural institutions and academic research. It is generally accepted that mass digitization projects led by museums, libraries and archives have allowed institutions to reach new audiences and increase the impact of their collections, while the emergence of digital libraries and other types of digital resources has opened up new opportunities for scholars in terms of accessing diverse types of information. Yet, our knowledge of the impact of these resources on the scholarly workflow beyond the stage of discovery remains limited. This paper argues for the importance of understanding user behavior and needs for building digital resources that have a positive effect on the whole scholarly workflow. By employing an ethnographic approach to the study of art historians’ habits we developed a sound understanding of the effect that digitization and digital resource design can have on scholars’ work, from the seeking of the information to the construction of the research argument. The complex information behavior of art historians and the challenges they often face when interacting with digital resources make them a great example to demonstrate the impact that these can have on the research process.},

	abstract = {As art museums undergo a digital transformation, institutions rethink physical exhibitions and print publications to create online resources that expand or replicate them. Collection websites, online exhibitions, online publications, exhibition websites, and online exhibition catalogues coexist with interactive features that cannot be easily categorized in the previous typologies, the exhibition and the publication. Often these different types of online resources share characteristics and functions. This article focuses on two of the most relevant online resources’ typologies in art museums: the online exhibition and the online publication. The aim of it is to discuss and understand what makes them similar or dissimilar and ultimately call into question the two typologies’ accuracy. The discussion is built upon empirical data representing the perspectives of art museum practitioners and a scholarly audience. The viewpoints of the two collectives help us understand existing conventions and interpretations with regards to online exhibitions and publications in art museums.},

	abstract = {This essay explores the parallel development of computer vision technology and digital art history, examining some of the current possibilities and limits of computational techniques applied to the cultural and historical studies of images. A fracture emerges: computer scientists seem to lack in the critical approach typical of the humanities, a shortfall which sometimes condemns their attempts to remain technological curiosities. For their part, humanists lack the technical knowledge that is needed to directly investigate large archives of images, with the result that art historians often must limit digital research to databases of text or metadata, a task that does not necessarily facilitate the study of the images themselves. A future dialogue between the two areas is required to foster this new branch of knowledge.},

We used a set of 120,000 paintings from different periods to analyze human faces between the 13th and the 20th centuries in order to establish whether there has been a single canon of beauty (that would maximize reproduction probabilities) or whether this has changed over time. Our study shows that when measuring averageness, symmetry, and orientation, the representation of human faces has not remained constant and that there are substantial differences between the faces depicted between the 15th and 18th centuries when compared to those of both the 13th and 20th centuries. Especially significant is the decrease in the perceived beauty of faces in 20th-century paintings, as the freedom of artists and the openness of society fostered the representation of different types of human faces other than that of classical styles.},

Focusing on the cognitive and structural potential of the frame, a common feature between analogue and digital art historical practice, we try to provide points of historical perspective through a selection of particular examples (Giorgio Vasari, Gustav Ludwig and Aby Warburg) and bring them closer to the notions of instrumentation and interface.},

@article{bentkowska-kafel_debating_nodate,
	title = {Debating {Digital} {Art} {History}},
	abstract = {This paper offers a few reflections on the origins, historiography and condition of the field often referred to as Digital Art History (DAH), with references, among others, to the activities of the Computers and the History of Art group (CHArt, est. 1985) and my personal experience, spanning over 20 years, first as a postgraduate student, then doctoral researcher and eventually Lecturer in DAH. The publications and teaching activities of scholars connected to CHArt are seen as indicative of the evolution of the field internationally. Personal experience, or a reality check, is limited to higher education in the UK. The key argument here concerns the questionable benefit of promoting DAH as a discrete discipline and detaching digital practices from the mainstream history of art and its institutions. When introduced in the late 1990s, the ‘DAH’ served to indicate a dramatic shift in the way art history could be practiced, taught, studied and communicated. The changes were brought about by widening access to computers and information technology. DAH was suggested—“perhaps a little ahead of time—as a new kind of intellectual fusion” (W. Vaughan). It is no longer necessary to argue for the wise use of computers. Digital technology has become part and parcel of teaching, learning and research. It is the History of Art and its more traditional research methods and critical perspectives that are seen at risk of neglect. The theories of crisis, even ‘death’ of Art History have contributed to general anxiety over the discipline’s future. However, a discipline has “the ability and power to control and judge its borders” (R. Nelson). The discipline of Art History is richer and stronger through the fusion of digital scholarship with, not separation, from more traditional methodologies and critical canons. The need to continue with the ‘digital’ distinction is questionable.},

@article{manovich_data_nodate,
	title = {Data {Science} and {Digital} {Art} {History}},
	abstract = {I present a number of core concepts from data science that are relevant to digital art history and the use of quantitative methods to study any cultural artifacts or processes in general. These concepts are objects, features, data, feature space, and dimension reduction. These concepts enable computational exploration of both large and small visual cultural data. We can analyze relations between works on a single artist, many artists, all digitized production from a whole historical period, holdings in museum collections, collection metadata, or writings about art. The same concepts allow us to study contemporary vernacular visual media using massive social media content. (In our lab, we analyzed works by van Gogh, Mondrian, and Rothko, 6000 paintings by French Impressionists, 20,000 photographs from MoMA photography collection, one million manga pages from manga books, one million artworks of contemporary non-professional artists, and over 13 million Instagram images from 16 global cities.) While data science techniques do not replace other art historical methods, they allow us to see familiar art historical material in new ways, and also to study contemporary digital visual culture.},

The potential for studying large groups of text automatically through techniques like text mining has meant that Franco Moretti’s “distant reading” has found more and more proponents. Art history, however, presents some unique barriers to uptake in computational techniques, not least the resistance of art historians, who have raised legitimate concerns about the relevance of such techniques. Many so-called “digital art history” projects focus only on formal characteristics while ignoring context, which does not reflect the nature of art historical study in the last 60 years. The technical challenges of using digital methodologies in the study of art and visual culture have limited the potential benefits of such techniques as well: the methodologies used for images are more complex than text recognition and there is simply not enough preexisting data that needs to be sorted in this way.},

The aim of this study is to develop and test a strategy for text mining from PDFs of journal articles that have nonstandard formatting and/or use notes rather than full bibliographies for references. While articles in the natural and social sciences typically adhere to standard formats, art history journals employ a variety of formatting styles that make bulk capture of citation and other textual data from the articles challenging. This study outlines a method by which researchers can extract data from journals articles, using a sample set from art history. Once extracted, the data from PDFs can be used to compare frequently used terms across samples and determine which scholars are most cited in either bibliographies or the main body text of articles. If the structure and layout of individual journals are carefully considered and the data is properly cleaned, a clear picture of the disciplinary influences and dependencies of the scholarship through citations and key terms can be obtained.},
